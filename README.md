## Contributing

`nbstata` is being developed using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). The
“nbs” directory is where edits to the source code should be made. (The
python code is then exported to the “nbdev” library folder.)

The [@patch_to](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#patch_to) decorator
is occasionally used to break up class definitions into separate cells.

## Acknowledgements

Kyle Barron authored the original `stata_kernel` and Vinci Chow carried
that work forward for Stata 17, converting the backend to use
[pystata](https://www.stata.com/python/pystata/). `nbstata` is directly
derived from his
[pystata-kernel](https://github.com/ticoneva/pystata-kernel).
